2. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch the server:
   `python main.py`

## 5. Troubleshooting
- **Status: Engine Offline:** Ensure `main.py` is running in your terminal.
- **Connection Error:** Check if your firewall is blocking port `8000`.
- **No triggers found:** If the confidence is low, the AI may not find specific high-risk words.
